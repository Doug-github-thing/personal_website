# My Personal Website

A personal blog-type website to act as a project portfolio for the fun stuff I've built.

Uses Firebase firestore to store blog posts in a live updated database. User can create new blog posts, modify the title and content of each post, and the client will automatically timestamp the time and date of the last edit of each post.

Pending implementation:
Need to add Google Oauth login so that only I can edit my posts. Also want to add the ability to add pictures, and have them stored in a separate portion of the database so that the post content can load first, and then the pictures.
